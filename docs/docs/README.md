# What is StarCraft2-API?

StarCraft2-API is a Node.js library which simplifies authorization and retrieving data from StarCraft II APIs offered by Blizzard: [Community APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/starcraft-2/community-apis) and [Game Data APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/starcraft-2/game-data-apis).

It is based on [BlizzAPI](https://github.com/blizzapi/blizzapi) and it inherits all BlizzAPI's public methods, making it possible to deeply and reliably integrate StarCraft2-API with any project or module based on data from StarCraft II APIs.
